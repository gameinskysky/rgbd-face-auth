# Novelty face authentication with liveness detection using depth and IR camera

## Style guide

### C++

Before pushing, code should be formatted with `clang-format` using the `-style=file` option, which will use the `.clang-format` file located in the main directory of this repository. Things not covered by `.clang-format`:

* Names of everything that can be used as a type - e.g. classes, structs, enums - should be written in CamelCase.
* Every other name - e.g. functions, variables - should be lowercase and use underscores.
* Use `.cpp` and `.hpp` file extensions.
* Header files should have definitions at the top of the file, and implementations below them. Don't split the implementation into a second file.

### Python

Refer to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
