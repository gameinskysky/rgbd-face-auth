\chapter{Work division}
    As this was a purely research project, it is hard to
    put clear line defining who made what at concept level.
    We all have learned many things and spent a lot of time
    on discussion of possible solutions and problem,
    so we all contributed to every part of project.
    However, two groups can be separated
    with greater contribution to other parts of the project.
    Face recognition -- Tomasz Garbus, Jan Ludziejewski.
    Liveness detection -- Dominik Klemba, Łukasz Raszkiewicz.
    But we weren't limited to our main subjects.
    More exact informations you may find below,
    but keep in midn above note.

\chapter{CD content}
    Included CD contains code to all final algorithms
    and models, as well as a lot of codes to
    to run some experiments which results are described in the paper.
    However many codes to abandoned or improved ideas are missing.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item libkinect
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AAA stuff
            \item BBB stuff
        \end{itemize}
        \item skin-recognition
        \item face-auth
        \item whitepaper
    \end{itemize}
