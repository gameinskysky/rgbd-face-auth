\section*{Abstract}
Bio-metric authentication has the potential to become
one of the safest authentication methods.
Currently, commonly used methods are slowly becoming obsolete,
due to the lack of convenience, adversarial technology
improvements or easy to make user errors.
This is why we believe there is a need to look for
new methods of authentication. Secure, convenient and efficient.\par

In this paper we describe our efforts to improve face recognition
using a camera with depth-perception capabilities, as well as
our search for new liveness detection methods to overcome
the imperfections of today's bio-authentication.\\
This text is mostly written with mobile solutions in mind,
but the results could also be applied in other settings.
