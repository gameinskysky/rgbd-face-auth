\section{Face authentication}
    Brief introduction to section.

    \subsection{Data set}
        Data set size and a few other informations.

    \subsection{Results}
        Wide discussion about final results of work.

        \subsubsection*{Quality measure}   % This star is fully intentional
            Wide explanation how model is scorred.

        \subsubsection*{Model description} % This too...
            Wide description of final model.

    \subsection{Using skin detection in face authentication}
            Brief description of motivations.

        \subsubsection*{Face detection}
            Wide summary of face detection with
            skin detection algorithm.

        \subsubsection*{Additional layer -- security improvement?}
            Wide summary.
            Assumption : skin detection is often correct.
            % With our best sd model.

    \subsection{ML Model and utilities}
        % You may want to consider
        % division of that subsection to more.
        Brief description of subsection.
        \subsubsection{Model 1}  % And here we don't have star!
            % If you want, you may create
            % new .tex file with content
            % of experiment description.
            %
            % Create them in content dictionary.
