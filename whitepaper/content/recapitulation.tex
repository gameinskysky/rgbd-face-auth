\section{Conclusions}
    Face recognition based authentication methods have been around for a while. However,
    they have always been considered nothing more than a nice feature, used mainly for
    quick unlocking of a mobile device.\\
    We believe our work shows that face recognition can
    become a secure and really trustworthy authentication method while maintaining
    its speed and convenience.
