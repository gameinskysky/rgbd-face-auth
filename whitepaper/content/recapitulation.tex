\chapter{Conclusion}
    Face recognition based authentication methods have been around for a while. However,
    they have always been considered more of a gimmick rather than a serious
    authentication method. They are not secure enough and often are not reliable,
    for example because they don't work well in dark rooms.

    We believe our work shows that face recognition can become a secure and
    really trustworthy authentication method while being as or even more
    convenient than existing authentication methods.
    The tests on our database shows that the probability of accepting
    an unauthorized person is low enough to secure everything that is not top secret,
    and face recognition with a depth camera does not have most inconveniences
    of known bio-authentication methods -- such as fingerprint scanners not
    being usable in gloves or having to look directly at the camera for
    retina scanners.

    Additionally, we showed a proof of concept for skin recognition using
    hyperspectral images. We believe that with further research into
    using higher wavelengths or using more different wavelengths,
    which we were not able to do due to a lack of needed hardware,
    this could improve the security of face authentication even further.
